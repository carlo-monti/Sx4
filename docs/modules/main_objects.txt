## Main patch objects

Here are the specs for the objects that must be used in the main.pd patch.

### main_connection

This is used to connect modules within the main patch. It has ID and osc name as arguments: **[main_connection 1 synth]** will
have an ID of 1 and receives OSC messages as synth. A **[note_receiver]** can be connected above it (on its inlet).

### main_connection_ext_1

This is connected to a pd~ objects to connect modules that are loaded as a subprocess. It has ID and osc name as arguments: **[main_connection 1 synth]** will
have an ID of 1 and receives OSC messages as synth. A **[note_receiver]** can be connected above it (on its inlet).

### main_connection_ext_2 [...]

This is connected to a pd~ objects to connect multiple modules that are loaded as a subprocess within the same wrapping. 
It has many ID and osc name as arguments as modules inside the wrapping. If the object is **[main_connection 1 synth 2 synthfx]** the first
will module inside the wrapping will have an ID of 1 and receives OSC messages as synth whereas the second will have an ID of 2 and receives osc as synthfx. 
Many **[note_receiver]** can be connected above it (on its inlets).

### main_preset_handler

This is used to load and save presets. It must be connected with a main_connection object using an ID of 100 and (optional) an OSC
